# My Game Library

My Game Library is a web application created with Java, Vaadin, and PostgreSQL. This is a website where you can store your current games in a database. You can also edit or delete a game.

Motivation:
I have worked on a school project with Java and Vaadin for the first time. After that project, I decided to make this small web application to see what I had learned.
